### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Implement Form Validation in React Without Any Libraries](https://hackernoon.com/implement-form-validation-in-react-without-any-libraries) - This helped me for implementing clien side form validation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://web.dev/learn/html/details/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to build accordion with just html and css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. I will write this thing on my blog soon‚úåÔ∏è.
